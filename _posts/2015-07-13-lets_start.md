This (Date : 09/07/2015) was our first meet with Anuj and Ninad (from [Bleetech](http://www.getblee.com/)).  
This was a introduction session Anuj introduces us(me and my Team [Sitaram](http://sitaramshelke.github.io), [Chinmay](http://chinmay1994.github.io/) and [Vivek](http://pimprikarvivek.github.io/) AKA IoTians) with his team of _Bleetech_.
Anuj gave us brief idea about _'How to use git?'_ and told us more about its features which I was unaware about.  
He covers many other topics including:

- Git
- Slack
- Issues
- Merging
- Pull requests
- IRC etiquette
- Blogging
