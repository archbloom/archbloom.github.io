This (Date : 09/07/2015) was our first meet with Anuj and Ninad (from [Bleetech](http://www.getblee.com/)).  
This was a introduction session Anuj introduces us(me and my Team [Sitaram](http://sitaramshelke.github.io), [Chinmay](http://chinmay1994.github.io/) and [Vivek](http://pimprikarvivek.github.io/) AKA IoTians) with his team of *Bleetech*. Anuj gave us brief idea about *'How to use git?'* and told us more about its features which I was unaware about.  
He covers many other topics including:  

* Git  
* Slack  
* Issues  
* Merging  
* Pull requests  
* IRC etiquette  
* Blogging
