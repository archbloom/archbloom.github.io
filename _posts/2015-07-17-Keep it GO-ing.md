This was the second week. Week was Heavy, lot many things happened in this week.
Our first meet of the week was with Ninad. He just brushed up our electronics basics. He told us about the communication protocols (*SPI -Serial Peripheral Interface* and *I2C-Inter-Integrated Circuit*) which are used in serial and parallel devices.
Second meet was with Anuj. He told us about GoLang and its basics, from scratch to running a simple echo server locally. He told us about the pros and cons of Go and other languages(sort of comparison). He also gave us a assignment - Implement data.sparkfun.com without a database i.e. store 4 public/private keys and check if they are valid
