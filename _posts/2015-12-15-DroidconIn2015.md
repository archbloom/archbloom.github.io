We (me along with my team [Chinmay](http://chinmay1994.github.io/) and [Sitaram](http://sitaramshelke.github.io/)) have developed a Android application for [Anuj's](http://www.anujdeshpande.com/) talk at [DroidCon-In 2015](http://droidcon.in/) to show how we can create context aware navigation experiences using beacons. We have used [Estimote beacons](http://estimote.com/) as hardware and their [Estimote Android sdk](https://github.com/Estimote/Android-SDK) libraries for the application.

Beacon is a small transmitting device which continuously transmits signals at regular intervals within a short range. We have used Estimote beacons with Eddystone which is a protocol specification for defining the beacons message format. Beacon uses Bluetooth low energy i.e. Bluetooth 4.0 AKA Bluetooth Smart.  
For more details about Beacons visit [here](http://blog.makerville.io/building-apps-using-eddystone-part-1).

You can download the app form Google Play Store [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=droidcon_phyweb.makerville.com.droidcon_phyweb&hl=en).

You will need beacons with Eddystone format to test the app.

Here are some of the screenshots of the application:

Its an open source project you can also contribute.
