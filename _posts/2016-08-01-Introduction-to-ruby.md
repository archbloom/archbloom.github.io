I recently started learning Ruby. My friend once said, The best way to start learning is hands-on and write about it.  
But where to write, hence blog it.  

Yukihiro Matsumoto AKA Matz in mid 1990's created a scripting language. It is named 'Ruby'. Ruby is Pure Object-Oriented programming language.  
It is said that  
**Ruby is "A Programmer's Best Friend".**  
Yes I believe it.  
* Ruby has clean syntax.  
* Ruby is a server-side scripting language.  
* Ruby is a general-purpose, interpreted programming language.  
* Reading Ruby code is like reading English sentence.  
There is no need of indentation in Ruby, but you should follow the convention of two character indentation.  
  
Lets get started. Lets write first code, I don't know why but it is always '  
Hello World'. I say go with 'world'.  

'''  
# hello_world.rb  
def hello_world  
  puts "Hello World!"  
end  
'''  

Run this script as :  
$ ruby hello_world.rb  

Output will be :   
Hello World!  

# indicates single line comment   
"""   
sentences or code in between these are comments.   
Used for multiline comment
